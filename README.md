# Task 7 — Browser Extensions Audit (Chrome)

**Author:** Likhith Bharadwaj Reddy  
**Date:** 2025-10-02

## Objective  
Audit all installed Chrome extensions, identify suspicious or malicious ones, remove them, and document the process and findings.

## Deliverables  
- `report.md` — analysis, list of removed/disabled extensions, and observations  
- `commands.md` — commands or steps (if any) you used (e.g. for cleanup)  
- `removed-list.md` — table/list of removed extensions with reasons  

## How to Use This Repo  
1. Read `removed-list.md` for what was removed and why  
2. Read `report.md` for methodology and detailed findings  
3. Check `commands.md` for any commands or steps used  

## Notes & Caution  
- Don’t publish real credentials or sensitive logs  
- Be careful when removing extensions — verify before deleting  
- The repo is for documentation of your audit, not for distributing tools
